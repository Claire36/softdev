# K22: Testing On-Ramps

## DISCO:

- It's easier to customize items with complex or special designs with Tailwind, since there seem to be more options for nuanced things.
- Bootstrap makes it easier to customize special items, such as accordions and navbars.
- Foundation seems similar to Bootstrap - there are also cool gadgets built in, but you can customize them a bit more.

## QCC:

- What does aria- signify at the beginning of an attribute?
- Why must "$(document).ready(function() {$(document).foundation();})" be added to the foundation file for accordion items to stay open? What specifically does it do?
- Is there a way to customize items like accordions and dropdowns with Tailwind? How much more difficult would it be compared to Foundations and Bootstrap?

## q1.

I prefer Tailwind, since it gives us the most freedom to add nuanced customizations. It gives us more room to create a unique design and it would probably be the nicest to work with, even if it doesn't make it as easy as Bootstrap or Foundation to customize special items that they built in.
