Time Spent: 3

Plan: 
If a user logs in, then add their username to the session. Then, instead of showing them the login page, show them the home page.
Check if the user is logged in by checking if 'username' is in session.
When a user logs out, remove their username from the session using session.pop('username').
The HTML templates are for logging in, the homepage displaying the username, and the logout screen. When a user is not logged in, they are prompted to enter their username. Then, they can see the homepage until they log out, which is when they will see a confirmation that they logged out successfully.
