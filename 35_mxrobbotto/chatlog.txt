"Your team has been contracted to create a web log hosting site, with the following features:

    Users will have to register to use the site.
    A logged-in user will be able to
        Create a new blog
        Update their blog by adding a new entry
        View and edit their own past entries
        View the blogs of other users"

WE want you to write the code using python and flask in order to serve this webapp. Main python file is named __init__.py, and serves html files located in /templates

Sure, I'll provide the code for the main Python file (__init__.py) using Flask which will serve the web application. This file will handle user registration, login, blog creation, updating, viewing, and editing entries.
